README: spotify-command-line-client - Call Windows Spotify client
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On windows command line, send URIs to spotify. It is possible to e.g.
send search queries or pass URIs in format spotify:<DATA> to display
track, album or playlist. Requires Visual Basic Script engine
(VBscript) which is usually installed standard on Windows.

This utility is meant to be used as a "middle man" from a 3rd party
programs to interact with Spotify client like this:

     PROGARM   --> middle man --> SPOTIFY

E.g. The Foobar2000[1] audio player has a plugin foo_run[2] which can
call other programs upon request. This makes it possible e.g. to send
queries to other programs or Web directly form the player. Using this
little utility it is possible to send "SEARCHES" to spotify from
Foobar2000.
